## Quickstart
1. Ask one of your friend to play Reversi with you.
2. Open [https://mac1xa3.ca/u/xiny13/simpleapp.html](https://mac1xa3.ca/u/xiny13/simpleapp.html) and wait it to load.
3. Start to play with a hand-held pointing device that detects two-dimensional motion relative to a surface connected to your laptop.
4. Laugh at your firend after you win, ez.

## Game Rules
Reversi is a strategy board game on a square grid (typically 8*8 sized) board. There are two types of game pieces called disks with **black** and **white** color. 

Initially, there are 4 disks (2 black, 2 white) staggered at the center of the board. 

When the game starts, two players take turns placing disks on the board with their own color, and **when a disk was placed, the different colored disks between that disk and other same colored disks (in horizontal, vertical and diagonal directions and with no space between) will be flipped (i.e. change color).** 

The placement of a disk is **only allowed when this placement can at least flip one of another playerâ€™s disks.** 

The object of this game is to have more disks with your color when the grid is totally filled.

### ps
The AI player is still performance extremely badly (even worse than the random) so far, so I decide to remove that part in this final submission.
